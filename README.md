## What is this project?
This is a simple Java program which takes in a string from the user and uses a While loop to store it in an array. This will occur infinitely until the user enters the string "END" which will then break the loop and print out all of the strings stored in the array. If the user enters the string "CLEAR" the array will be cleared of all previously entered strings.
